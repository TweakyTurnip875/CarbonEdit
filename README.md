# CarbonEdit

## Synopsis
This project is a text editor application similar to Notepad. It is currently a work in progress, so I will be adding many new features in the future.

## Motivation
I decided to build this application because I found that many text editors were not as useful to me as they could have been. For example, notepad lacks several text manipulation features, including several
text manipulation features like settings for italic text, bold text, changing fonts, and more. Additionally, applications like Microsoft Word do not offer an good experience for developers. I hope to
create an application that is both useful for developers and regular users.

## How to Run
- Recomended Java Version: Java 8
<ol>
  <li>Download on Github page or clone with Git/Github Client</li>
  <li>Execute the Editor class as the main class or execute Editor.java</li>
</ol>
